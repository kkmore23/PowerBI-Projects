3. Purchase Order Report

- Wide World Importers (WWI) is a wholesale novelty goods importer and distributor operating from the San Francisco bay area.

  As a wholesaler, WWI's customers are mostly companies who resell to individuals. WWI sells to retail customers across the United States including specialty stores, supermarkets,   computing stores, tourist attraction shops, and some individuals. WWI also sells to other wholesalers via a network of agents who promote the products on WWI's behalf. While all   of WWI's customers are currently based in the United States, the company is intending to push for expansion into other countries.

  WWI buys goods from suppliers including novelty and toy manufacturers, and other novelty wholesalers. They stock the goods in their WWI warehouse and reorder from suppliers as     needed to fulfil customer orders. They also purchase large volumes of packaging materials, and sell these in smaller quantities as a convenience for the customers.

  Recently WWI started to sell a variety of edible novelties such as chilli chocolates. The company previously did not have to handle chilled items. Now, to meet food handling       requirements, they must monitor the temperature in their chiller room and any of their trucks that have chiller sections
